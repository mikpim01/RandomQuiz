# Welcome to my second GitHub Project!

## Introduction

I am King Squid, a person who is a code enthusiast. I design graphics and am currently learning HTML, Python and Batch. Python is a beginners programming language and I have RandomQuiz using it. It's a completely random quiz and I will add to it. Don't judge. Enjoy!
